## Introduction

A few words about things that I have watched. I watch way too much TV. So I might as well try and write a few things about what I am watching/what I thought so that I can refer back to it when I want.

### Dr. Who (S11)

I'll be honest, it took me a while to get used to the new Doctor. I haven't really watched much since David Tennant (I know, I should have been doing better...) so I feel the new Doctor had big shoes to fill. There is also whe whole dynamic with having a larger group following around the Doctor rather than only a single person. Initially I found this slightly frustrating as the dynamics between the people and the Doctor are quite different (I find), but after a few episodes I feel everything falls into a bit of a rhythm and it gets better and better.

One thing I am slightly concerned about is that it feels like it is trying to pull in and discuss issues around marginalised people and issues. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are at least two episodes that come immediately to mind which feel like they are direct commentary on our past (and more current) political climate surrounding persecution of minorities. This is not to say that I am not sympathetic of the achievements of these movements (and the people involved), it does feel a little like they are put there to get more eyeballs on the series. I feel that is a bit of a shame as I had the impression that Dr. Who was a bit of a laugh and didn't really engage with anything too serious.

I hope this doesn't scare you off, I am enjoying the series and am not seeing any signs of slowing down! I look forward to seeing what the Doctor has in store for me tonight.
