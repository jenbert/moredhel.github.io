## Introduction

Welcome to the place where I try and keep a record of some of the books that I have read/am reading/want to read. Firstly, my goodreads account is a pretty good place to start if you just want to see what I've read, [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18941204-hamish-hutchings). Let the books commence

## Read

### [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/95/Mother-of-Learning)

This is a very interesting 'GroundHog-day'-esque book about a young wizard trying to uncover a conspiracy. If you are a fan of world building and the process of learning, then this is definitely the book for you.

## To Read

### Philosophy

[Loves Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/759251.Love_s_Work), recommended by Jen. Apparently it is worth a read.
