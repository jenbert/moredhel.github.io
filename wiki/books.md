## Introduction

Welcome to the place where I try and keep a record of some of the books that I have read/am reading/want to read. Firstly, my goodreads account is a pretty good place to start if you just want to see what I've read, [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18941204-hamish-hutchings). Let the books commence

## Reading

### [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/95/Mother-of-Learning)

This is a very interesting 'GroundHog-day'-esque book about a young wizard trying to uncover a conspiracy. If you are a fan of world building and the process of learning, then this is definitely the book for you.

### [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/2017/09/11/daybreak-1-1/)

Ward is the second in the Parahumans universe. I don't really know anything about it as I haven't actually started it yet. I hear it is quite a different read to [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/) though which has more action and is a more active read.
This second book follows the life of Ward, a hero who has been left in the aftermath of the escape through the portal.

## To Read

### Philosophy

[Loves Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/759251.Love_s_Work), recommended by Jen. Apparently it is worth a read.

## Read

### [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/)

A story about a young woman who discovers she has super-powers. She then struggles to find a place in the world and in doing the right thing to achieve her goals. It is a really interesting read about the struggles of fitting in and fighting against the system. This is a really interesting read but does take a bit of time to build up. The general concensus is around 20 chapters before things start really getting going.

Good luck reading it! It is a fun ride
