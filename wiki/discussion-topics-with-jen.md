## Welcome!

Consider this a forum to talk about [things and stuff](http://www.poorlydrawnlines.com/comic/things-and-stuff/). What are things? What is stuff? All this and more!

## In the Beginning

there was nothing, so let's begin. I have put down a few of the questions that we had in our chat. Definitely add recommended readings to help direct the discussions.

## The List

- What is a resource?
- What is necessity (vs. want)?
	- Does this tie into what humanities' end-goals are? (should they have end-goals?)
