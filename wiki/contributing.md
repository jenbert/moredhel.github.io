So normally this kind of post would be in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, but because I don't really want to figure out how to get Jekyll to render things correctly it will be done here and linked from the front page.

It may seem weird to even have a contributing concept for a private blog/wiki allowing contribution from others. Oh well, it is what I have decided.

Despite this, the barrier to entry is not _that_ low. One will need to have a [Github](github.com) account, as well as understand how to fork repositories and use git (sorry).

There is a pretty reasonable guide to this [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) which has screenshots on the steps necessary in order to make changes. Personally I would recommend installing [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). Although to start off, it is entirely possible to just make your changes [in the repository itself](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

This may seem crazy and way more complicated than it needs to be. In that case, I'm sorry, it's just the way it is (you _may_ thank me later).

If you really aren't sure how to go ahead, then I'm happy to help out. Please make sure you have done the following beforehand though:

- created a GitHub account
- downloaded and logged into the GitHub Desktop app
- downloaded and installed VSCode

Thanks for wanting to contribute!
