## A New Post - Maybe 

*cries*

Hello world! Am I able to write, or am I screaming into the void even more so that usual? Oh well. I'll try post this and see how far I get. 

I thought I'd send this copy of Bruno Latour's excellent essay, _Where are the missing masses? The sociology of a few mundane artifacts_, which you would probably enjoy were this post postable, and were I able to figure out how to attach the beedin' pdf. As a thinker and writer, Latour's 'big thing' (which he called _Actor Network Theory_, or _ANT_) has developed so much since these early writings. He has since channeled his ideas surrounding non-human actors into a sustainability discourse, a conversation which is as equally fascinating as this initial conceptialising, and something we should definitely foray into, but for now I thought this was a fun and light-ish read. Enjoy!
